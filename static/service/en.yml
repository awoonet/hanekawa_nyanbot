        Sorry, I don't know these categories in English(
          Empathy, Food, Greetings
        Please, help me to learn it, write to @nyawoobot.

        You can perform an action by writing one of the commands:
        /pat, /hug, /paw, /koos, /lapk, /jamk, /lick, /kiss, /boop

        You can select a specific user by replying to their message, or by writing their nickname after the "@".
        If you do not specify someone, then your hugs will go to a random user.

        There is also a /me command that allows you to simply perform an action on your behalf.
        Let's imagine that your nickname is @nyawoobot. The command "/me growls" will be answered as "*@nyawoobot growls*")

        I can be in several moods, and I can speak several languages.
        My native language is Russian, also I know English, but my Ukrainian is not good at all.
        If you want to help me learn new or improve the level of old languages, please write to @nyawoobot.

        About moods, I have 4 main ones - the usual (nyan), anger, scared and horny ^-^.
