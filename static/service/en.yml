        You can perform an action by writing one of the commands:
        /pat, /hug, /paw, /koos, /lapk, /jamk, /lick, /kiss, /boop

        You can select a specific user by replying to their message, or by writing their nickname after the "@".
        If you do not specify someone, then your hugs will go to a random user.

        There is also a /me command that allows you to simply perform an action on your behalf.
        Let's imagine that your nickname is @nyawoobot. The command "/me growls" will be answered as "*@nyawoobot growls*")

        I can greet new chat users when they come to us.
        The greeting depends on the language set in the chat.
        The default greeting is:
          {default_greeter}
        And now the chat is set to this greeting:
          {chat_greeter}

        You can change the greeting with the command `/greeter New greeting text`.
        In the greeting, you can use `{username}` and `{title}` to insert the username and chat title.
        If you changed the greeting and then wanted to return it to the default, then change it to "default".
